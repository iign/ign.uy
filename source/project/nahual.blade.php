@section('project_intro')
<p>
    Proyecto Nahual is an volunteer-driven initiative to promote social inclusion by
    generating job opportunities for young people, through software testing workshops.
</p>
<p>
    I joined the team in 2014. Since then, we have introduced many students
    into the world of technology and many start careers in software testing.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from coordinating, class preparation and delivery, I help with the
    project's branding and identity through social media and print.
